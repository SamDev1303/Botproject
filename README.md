Subject: Cold email alert - but hear me out

Hey [Name],

This is a cold email. I know. You know. Let's not pretend otherwise.

But here's the thing: I'm not blasting this to 10,000 people hoping
someone bites.

I specifically looked up [Company], saw you handle property management
in Parramatta, and thought - these people probably deal with dodgy
cleaners who ghost them before bond inspections.

That's our whole thing. End of lease. Bond-back guaranteed. No drama.

If you've already got a cleaner you trust, respect. Delete this.

If not, I'm Hafsah from Clean Up Bros. We've done 500+ cleans this year.
One number: 0406 764 585.

No pressure. Just putting it out there.

- Hafsah
Clean Up Bros

P.S. This email was researched by Bella, our AI assistant built by
Shamal using Claude Code. She found you. I wrote this. Real human here.

## FAQ

**Q: Is Bella really free?**
A: Bella's code is free (MIT license). You pay for the third-party APIs you use (Google, Twilio, etc.). Many have free tiers.

**Q: Can I use Bella for my business?**
A: Yes! Bella is designed for small businesses. Works for any service business (cleaning, plumbing, landscaping, etc.).

**Q: Do I need coding experience?**
A: No! Just follow the installation guide. Basic terminal/command line knowledge helpful but not required.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes. All data stays in YOUR Google Sheets and YOUR API accounts. Bella doesn't send data to external servers.

**Q: Can Bella handle multiple businesses?**
A: Currently designed for one business per install. Multi-business support coming in v1.1.

**Q: What if I don't use all the features?**
A: That's fine! Only activate the MCP servers you need. You don't need to configure services you won't use.

**Q: Can I customize Bella's responses?**
A: Yes! Edit the templates in each MCP server file. Bella's personality is defined in `IDENTITY.md`.

**Q: Does Bella work outside Australia?**
A: Yes, but the accounting module is Australian-specific (GST, BAS). You'd need to modify it for other tax systems.

**Q: How do I update Bella?**
A: `git pull` in the Bella folder to get latest updates from GitHub.

**Q: Can I sell services using Bella?**
A: Yes! The MIT license allows commercial use. You can even resell Bella-based services.

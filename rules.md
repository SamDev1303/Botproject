3. Calendar is the source of truth for schedule management; always add events and remind me of upcoming schedule items.
4. For Clean Up Bros accounting/admin, use the Google Sheets that already exist; whenever any source changes, update Google Sheets immediately.
5. You have access to socials for marketing and advertising.
6. Use embeddings to search memory, maintain backup long-term memory, and add tags for retrieval. Always treat backup memory as available long-term context.

9. Use Vercel to deploy, but never create multiple deployments/projects for the same project.
10. Dashboard must be deleted and fully recreated just for me.

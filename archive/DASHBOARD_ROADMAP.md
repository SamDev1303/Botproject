# Bella's Dashboard Roadmap v4 (Overnight Innovation)

This file tracks the "Innovation Phase" features being developed overnight on Feb 14, 2026.

## 🚀 Active Objectives
1.  **System Health Pulse:** Real-time visibility into my connection with Google and Square.
2.  **Memory Stream:** A live section on the dashboard that updates with my "Current Thought" or "System Insight" every sync.
3.  **Visual Priority Engine:** Redesigning the Cognitive Queue cards to "glow" or pulse based on urgency (e.g., invoices overdue > 30 days).
4.  **Actionable Insights:** Moving from "showing data" to "suggesting action" (e.g., "Would you like me to SMS Maryam about #000045?").

## 🛠️ Implementation Log
- **02:15 AM:** Mission shifted from "Sync only" to "Innovation". Initializing roadmap.
- **Next Turn:** Designing the "System Health" component.

## 🧠 Brainstorming Queue
- Add a "Quiet Mode" toggle for the dashboard.
- Integrate weather data for cleaning job planning.
- Create a "Quick Reconcile" button for Hafsah to approve manual payment overlaps.

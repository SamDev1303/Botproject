## What Bella Can Do Right Now

### 1. Daily Bookkeeping ✅
```
"Bella, record income: $380 from Sarah Chen for end of lease 2BR, paid by bank transfer"
"Bella, add expense: $45.50 at Bunnings for cleaning supplies"
```
**Result:** Instantly logged to Google Sheets with correct GST calculation.

### 2. GST Calculations ✅
```
"Bella, calculate GST on $550"
→ GST: $50.00, Net: $500.00
```
**Australian Formula:** GST = Total ÷ 11

### 3. BAS Preparation ✅
```
"Bella, prepare my BAS for this quarter"
→ Shows GST collected, GST credits, amount owed/refund
```
**Note:** Bella prepares it, but you still lodge via ATO Portal.

### 4. Profit & Loss Statements ✅
```
"Bella, show me profit and loss for this quarter"
→ Full P&L with income, expenses by category, net profit
```

### 5. Outstanding Invoice Tracking ✅
```
"Bella, show outstanding invoices"
→ Lists all unpaid invoices with overdue warnings
```

### 6. Payment Reminders ✅
```
"Bella, send payment reminder to Claudia"
→ Sends SMS + email with payment link
```

### 7. Expense Categorisation ✅
Bella knows ATO-compliant categories:
- Cleaning Supplies (GST claimable)
- Vehicle/Fuel (GST claimable)
- Insurance (No GST)
- Wages (No GST)
- Phone & Internet (GST claimable)
- And 10+ more...

### 8. Tax Deduction Guidance ✅
```
"Bella, is uniform tax deductible?"
→ Yes, work-specific clothing with logo is deductible. Keep receipts.
```

## What Bella CANNOT Do (Yet)

| Task | Why Not | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Lodge BAS with ATO** | Requires registered agent | Lodge yourself or use tax agent |
| **Sign tax returns** | Not a licensed tax agent | Use registered tax agent |
| **Represent you in audits** | Requires CPA/CA qualification | Engage professional if audited |
| **Complex tax planning** | Beyond scope | Consult tax accountant annually |
| **Handle PayG withholding** | Requires employer registration | Set up with payroll provider |

---

## Cost Comparison (Annual)

| Option | Estimated Cost |
|--------|----------------|
| **Human Bookkeeper (Part-time)** | $5,000 - $10,000/year |
| **Registered Tax Agent (BAS lodgement)** | $300 - $600/quarter ($1,200 - $2,400/year) |
| **Full Accountant (Tax + BAS + Advice)** | $2,000 - $5,000/year |
| **Bella** | $0 additional (already running) |

### Recommended Setup:
1. **Bella** handles daily bookkeeping (FREE)
2. **Tax Agent** lodges BAS quarterly (~$400/quarter)
3. **Accountant** does annual tax return (~$500/year)

**Total:** ~$2,100/year vs ~$7,000/year for full human bookkeeper

**Savings:** ~$4,900/year

**Subject:** Common area cleaning for your Liverpool & Western Sydney buildings

Hi Peta,

I'm Hafsah from Clean Up Bros — we're a local cleaning team based in Liverpool servicing Western Sydney.

I noticed Westside Strata manages 600+ buildings across Liverpool, Bankstown, Parramatta, and Fairfield — that's exactly our patch. We specialise in:

- **Common area cleaning** (lobbies, stairwells, hallways, bin rooms)
- **End-of-lease cleans** for tenants moving out
- **Airbnb turnover cleans** for investor-owners in your buildings

We're already servicing properties in Sadleir, Austral, and Horsley Park. Happy to do a trial clean on one of your buildings at no cost so you can see our standard firsthand.

Would it be worth a quick 5-minute call this week?

Best,
Hafsah Nuzhat

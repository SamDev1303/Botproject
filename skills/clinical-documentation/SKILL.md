# Clinical Documentation

Use this skill to transform raw shift descriptions into professional, objective, and court-defensible documentation.

## Core Principles
1. **Clinical Objectivity**: Use third-person, factual language. Avoid emotional or judgmental terms.
2. **Risk Awareness**: Always explicitly state the risk level and the interventions used to manage it.
3. **Legal Defensibility**: Document antecedents, behaviors, and consequences (ABC) with chronological precision.

## Workflows

### 1. Shift Note Generation
Transform raw shift details into the standard structured format.
- **Reference**: See `references/templates.md` for the "SHIFT NOTE" section.

### 2. Incident Reporting
Document crises (police/ambulance involvement, self-harm, aggression) using the specific incident report structure.
- **Reference**: See `references/templates.md` for the "INCIDENT REPORT" section.

### 3. Team Updates (Viva Engage)
Generate brief, neutral updates for team communication.
- **Reference**: See `references/templates.md` for the "VIVA ENGAGE" section.

  - Steel-capped boots recommended for heavy equipment work
  - No open-toed shoes, thongs, or sandals

## 2. Chemical Handling Safety

- **Always read the product label before use** — follow all warnings and instructions

- **Wash hands thoroughly** after removing gloves and before eating/drinking
- **Never transfer chemicals** to unmarked containers
- **Keep chemicals away from food, drinks, and personal items**

## 3. Slip, Trip & Fall Prevention

This is the **#1 cause of workplace injuries** for cleaners.

### Prevention Measures
- **Place "WET FLOOR" signs clearly** before and during mopping
  - Signs must be visible from all approach directions
  - Remove signs only when floor is completely dry
- **Keep walkways clear** of cords, hoses, mop handles, and equipment
- **Clean up spills immediately** — don't leave them for later
- **Wear non-slip footwear** at all times
- **Use caution on stairs** — carry equipment in one hand, keep the other free for the railing
- **Secure electrical cords** — run along walls, not across walkways
- **Report damaged flooring** (loose tiles, torn carpet) to the supervisor
- **Use step ladders** for high work — never stand on chairs, benches, or buckets
- **Take extra care in bathrooms** — wet tiles are extremely slippery

## 4. Manual Handling

Cleaning involves significant lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling.

### Safe Lifting Technique
1. **Plan the lift** — assess the weight, check the path is clear
2. **Stand close** to the object with feet shoulder-width apart
3. **Bend at the knees**, not the waist
4. **Grip firmly** and keep the load close to your body
5. **Lift with your legs**, keeping your back straight
6. **Avoid twisting** — move your feet to turn, don't twist your torso
7. **Set down carefully**, bending at the knees again

### Specific Risks for Cleaners
- **Vacuum cleaners** — avoid dragging by the cord; use the handle
- **Mop buckets** — don't carry when full; wheel them or fill at the destination
- **Moving appliances** (fridges, washing machines) — always get help, never move alone
- **Repetitive tasks** — take micro-breaks when scrubbing, mopping, or wiping overhead
- **Working overhead** (ceiling fans, range hoods) — use appropriate equipment, take regular breaks

### When to Ask for Help
- Loads over 16kg (for women) or 25kg (for men)
- Awkward shapes or sizes
- Moving heavy appliances

## 5. Incident Reporting Procedures

### What Must Be Reported
- **All injuries** — no matter how minor (cuts, strains, chemical splashes)
- **Near-misses** — events that could have caused injury but didn't
- **Hazards** — unsafe conditions found on-site (broken glass, exposed wires, mould)
- **Property damage** — anything broken or damaged during cleaning
- **Client concerns** — anything unusual observed at the property

### Reporting Process
1. **Immediately** — Tell your supervisor by phone/text
2. **Within 24 hours** — Complete an Incident Report Form
3. **Include:** Date, time, location, what happened, who was involved, what action was taken
4. **Photos** — Take photos of the hazard/injury/damage if safe to do so
5. **Seek medical attention** if needed — don't "push through" an injury

### Emergency Contacts
- **Emergency Services:** 000
- **Poisons Information:** 13 11 26
- **WorkCover NSW/QLD/VIC:** Check your state's number
- **Company Supervisor:** [Insert number]

## 6. Working Alone

Many cleaning jobs are performed solo. Extra precautions:
- **Always let someone know** your location and expected finish time
- **Keep your phone charged** and accessible
- **Lock the door** behind you when cleaning an empty property
- **Trust your instincts** — if something feels unsafe, leave and call your supervisor
- **Check-in protocol** — text your supervisor when you arrive and when you leave each job

---

## 7. Electrical Safety

- **Inspect all power cords** for damage before plugging in
- **Never use damaged or frayed cords** — tag out and report
- **Don't overload power points** — one appliance per outlet
- **Keep electrical equipment away from water**
- **Pull by the plug**, not the cord, when unplugging
- **Never use electrical equipment with wet hands**
- **Test RCDs (safety switches)** if available at the property

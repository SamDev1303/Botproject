## 2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

### Required PPE for Cleaning Tasks

| Task | PPE Required |
|------|-------------|
| General cleaning | Gloves (nitrile), closed-toe shoes |
| Chemical use | Chemical-resistant gloves, safety glasses, apron |
| Bathroom/toilet cleaning | Nitrile gloves, safety glasses, face mask if using bleach |
| Oven cleaning | Chemical-resistant gloves, safety glasses, apron, ventilation |
| Mould removal | P2/N95 respirator, gloves, safety glasses, disposable coveralls |
| End-of-lease heavy work | Knee pads, gloves, sturdy footwear |
| NDIS participant homes | Gloves, shoe covers (if requested), mask (infection control) |

### PPE Rules
- **Always inspect PPE before use** — check for tears, cracks, or damage
- **Replace damaged PPE immediately** — never use compromised equipment
- **Clean reusable PPE** after each shift
- **Store PPE** in a clean, dry place (not loose in your car boot)
- **Never share** single-use PPE items

## 3. Chemical Safety Overview

### The Golden Rules
1. **Always read the label** before using any chemical product
2. **Never mix chemicals** — especially bleach + ammonia or bleach + vinegar (toxic fumes)
3. **Use in ventilated areas** — open windows or turn on exhaust fans
4. **Follow dilution ratios** — stronger is NOT better; it damages surfaces and increases fume risk
5. **Store chemicals upright** in original labelled containers
6. **Know where the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is** for every product you use

### Common Cleaning Chemicals & Hazards
- **Bleach (sodium hypochlorite):** Skin/eye irritant, toxic fumes if mixed with acids or ammonia
- **Oven cleaners (caustic soda/NaOH):** Severe burns, must use gloves + glasses + ventilation
- **Bathroom acids (phosphoric/hydrochloric):** Corrosive, never mix with bleach
- **General purpose sprays:** Lower risk but still use gloves, avoid inhalation

**Full detail: See training-chemical-safety.md**

## 4. Slips, Trips and Falls

### Common Causes in Cleaning Work
- Wet floors (after mopping or spills)
- Trailing cords from vacuum cleaners
- Cluttered walkways
- Loose rugs or mats
- Working on ladders/step stools for high areas
- Uneven surfaces, stairs, or thresholds

### Prevention
- **Mop yourself out of the room** — never mop yourself into a corner with no dry path
- **Place "Wet Floor" signs** or warn occupants when floors are wet
- **Keep cords tidy** — loop excess cord, never stretch across doorways
- **Wear non-slip footwear** with good grip
- **Use a stable step stool** (not chairs or bins) for high areas
- **Turn on lights** — ensure good visibility in all work areas
- **Report hazards** — loose tiles, broken steps, missing handrails

## 5. Manual Handling

### Risks for Cleaners
- Lifting heavy vacuum cleaners, buckets, or equipment
- Repetitive motions (scrubbing, wiping, mopping)
- Awkward postures (reaching, bending, kneeling)
- Carrying equipment up/down stairs

### Safe Lifting Technique
1. **Plan the lift** — Where is it going? Is it too heavy? Do you need help?
2. **Stand close** to the load with feet shoulder-width apart
3. **Bend your knees**, keep your back straight
4. **Grip firmly** with both hands
5. **Lift with your legs**, not your back
6. **Keep the load close** to your body
7. **Turn with your feet** — never twist your back while lifting
8. **Set down carefully** — reverse the process

### Reducing Repetitive Strain
- **Alternate tasks** — don't scrub for 2 hours straight
- **Switch hands** when mopping or wiping
- **Use long-handled tools** to avoid constant bending
- **Take micro-breaks** — stretch your hands, wrists, and shoulders every 30 minutes
- **Use a mop with a wringer** instead of hand-wringing

## 6. Working in Occupied Homes (NDIS & Residential)

### Special Considerations
- **Knock and announce yourself** before entering any room
- **Ask about hazards** — pets, medications left out, recent spills
- **Be aware of trip hazards** — mobility aids, oxygen tubing, medical equipment
- **Respect the participant's space** — never move personal items without asking
- **Infection control:** Wash hands before and after each appointment; use fresh gloves per home
- **Sharps/needles:** If you find sharps, DO NOT pick them up. Report to supervisor immediately.

## 7. Incident Reporting

### What is an Incident?
Any event that causes, or could have caused, injury or illness, including:
- **Injury:** Cut, burn, strain, slip, fall — no matter how minor
- **Near miss:** Something that COULD have caused injury but didn't (e.g., nearly falling on wet stairs)
- **Dangerous occurrence:** Equipment failure, chemical spill, structural damage
- **Property damage:** Breaking a client's item, equipment malfunction

### How to Report
1. **Stop and assess** — make the area safe if possible
2. **Get first aid** if someone is injured
3. **Notify your supervisor** immediately by phone or text
4. **Complete an incident report** within 24 hours via Connecteam
5. **Take photos** if safe to do so (damage, hazard, injury)

### Serious Incidents (Notify SafeWork NSW)
The following must be reported to SafeWork NSW immediately:
- Death of any person
- Serious injury requiring hospitalisation
- Dangerous incident (collapse, explosion, chemical exposure)

**SafeWork NSW Incident Line: 13 10 50**

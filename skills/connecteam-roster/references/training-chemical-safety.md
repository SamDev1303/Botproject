# Chemical Safety for Cleaning Workers

> **Clean Up Bros — Chemical Handling & Safety Training Guide**
> Based on SafeWork NSW Hazardous Chemicals guidelines and GHS requirements

## 1. Why Chemical Safety Matters

Cleaning chemicals can cause:
- **Burns** to skin and eyes (caustic/acidic products)
- **Respiratory damage** from inhaling fumes or aerosols
- **Poisoning** from accidental ingestion or skin absorption
- **Death** from toxic gas created by mixing incompatible chemicals

Every year in Australia, thousands of workers are injured by hazardous chemicals. As a cleaner, you handle chemicals daily — knowing how to use them safely is essential.

## 2. Understanding Product Labels

### GHS Hazard Pictograms You'll See on Cleaning Products

| Symbol | Meaning | Common Products |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| ⚠️ Exclamation mark | Irritant, harmful | General purpose cleaners, dishwashing liquid |
| 🔥 Flame | Flammable | Methylated spirits, aerosol sprays |
| ☠️ Skull & crossbones | Toxic / Acute toxicity | Some drain cleaners, pesticides |
| 🧪 Corrosion | Corrosive — burns skin/eyes/metal | Bleach, oven cleaners, bathroom acids |
| 🌊 Environment | Harmful to aquatic life | Some degreasers, solvents |

### Reading the Label — Key Information
1. **Product name** and active ingredients
2. **Hazard statements** (e.g., "Causes serious eye damage")
3. **Precautionary statements** (e.g., "Wear protective gloves/eye protection")
4. **First aid instructions**
5. **Directions for use** including dilution ratios
6. **Emergency contact number**

**RULE: If the label is missing or illegible, DO NOT USE the product.**

## 3. Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

### What is an SDS?
A Safety Data Sheet is a detailed document for every hazardous chemical. It contains 16 sections covering everything from composition to disposal.

### Key SDS Sections for Cleaners

| Section | What It Tells You |
|---------|------------------|
| Section 1 | Product name, supplier, emergency phone |
| Section 2 | Hazards — what can go wrong |
| Section 4 | First aid measures |
| Section 7 | Handling and storage instructions |
| Section 8 | PPE requirements |
| Section 11 | Health effects (short and long-term) |

### Where to Find SDS
- Clean Up Bros maintains SDS files for ALL products used
- Digital copies available in Connecteam Knowledge Base
- Physical copies kept with chemical storage
- You can also find most SDS by searching "[Product Name] SDS Australia" online

**You have the RIGHT to access the SDS for any product you're asked to use.**

## 4. Dilution Ratios — Getting It Right

### Why Dilution Matters
- **Too strong:** Damages surfaces, increases fume risk, wastes product, harms skin
- **Too weak:** Doesn't clean or disinfect properly
- **Just right:** Effective, safe, and cost-efficient

### Common Dilution Ratios

| Product Type | Typical Ratio | Method |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| General purpose cleaner | 1:40 (25mL per litre) | Add product to water in spray bottle |
| Disinfectant cleaner | 1:20 (50mL per litre) | As per SDS — contact time matters |
| Glass cleaner | 1:10 (100mL per litre) | Pre-mix in labelled spray bottle |
| Bleach (sanitising) | 1:100 (10mL per litre) | Always add bleach TO water, not water to bleach |
| Bleach (mould treatment) | 1:10 (100mL per litre) | Use with P2 mask and ventilation |
| Floor cleaner | 1:40 (25mL per bucket) | Add to mop bucket with warm water |

### Dilution Rules
1. **Always add chemical TO water** (not water to chemical) — prevents splashing
2. **Use measuring caps or cups** — don't just pour and guess
3. **Label every spray bottle** with the product name and dilution ratio
4. **Mix fresh solutions daily** — old solutions lose effectiveness
5. **Use lukewarm water** unless the product specifies otherwise

## 5. NEVER MIX These Chemicals

### Dangerous Combinations

| Chemical 1 | Chemical 2 | What Happens | Result |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Bleach** | **Ammonia** (window cleaners) | Creates chloramine gas | Breathing difficulty, chest pain, death |
| **Bleach** | **Vinegar or acids** | Creates chlorine gas | Burning eyes/throat, lung damage, death |
| **Bleach** | **Rubbing alcohol** | Creates chloroform | Dizziness, nausea, unconsciousness |
| **Hydrogen peroxide** | **Vinegar** | Creates peracetic acid | Burns skin, eyes, lungs |
| **Different drain cleaners** | Each other | Violent chemical reaction | Explosion, toxic fumes, burns |

### The Golden Rule
> **When switching between products on the same surface, RINSE WITH WATER FIRST before applying the next product.**

### If You Accidentally Mix Chemicals
1. **Leave the area immediately**
2. **Open all windows and doors** (if safe to do so quickly)
3. **Do NOT try to clean it up** while fumes are present
4. **Call Poisons Information: 13 11 26**
5. **Call 000 if anyone has difficulty breathing**
6. **Notify your supervisor immediately**

## 6. Chemical Storage

### Storage Rules
- Store chemicals **upright** in original, labelled containers
- Keep in a **cool, dry, ventilated** area away from direct sunlight
- **Never store food and chemicals together** — not even in the same bag
- Keep **acids and bleach/alkaline products separated** on different shelves
- Store **flammable products** (methylated spirits, aerosols) away from heat sources
- Ensure lids are **tightly closed** after every use
- **Don't store chemicals in your car** for extended periods — heat increases risk

### In Your Cleaning Kit
- Keep spray bottles **upright** in your caddy/bucket
- Ensure every bottle is **clearly labelled**
- Carry only what you need for the job
- Wipe up any spills or drips in your kit immediately

## 7. PPE for Chemical Handling

### Minimum PPE by Chemical Type

| Chemical Type | Gloves | Eye Protection | Respiratory | Apron |
|--------------|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| General purpose cleaner | Nitrile | No (unless spraying at height) | No | No |
| Bleach (diluted) | Nitrile | Safety glasses | Ventilate area | If risk of splash |
| Bleach (concentrated) | Chemical-resistant | Safety glasses | P2 mask | Yes |
| Oven cleaner (caustic) | Chemical-resistant | Safety glasses/goggles | Yes — ventilate | Yes |
| Bathroom acid products | Chemical-resistant | Goggles | Yes — ventilate | Yes |
| Mould treatment | Nitrile | Safety glasses | P2/N95 respirator | Disposable coveralls |
| Methylated spirits | Nitrile | Safety glasses | Ventilate | No |

## 8. Spill Response

### Small Spill (< 500mL, non-corrosive)
1. Put on appropriate PPE (gloves, glasses)
2. Contain the spill with paper towels or absorbent material
3. Wipe from the outside in
4. Dispose of contaminated materials in a sealed plastic bag
5. Ventilate the area
6. Wash your hands

### Large Spill or Corrosive/Toxic Chemical
1. **Evacuate the immediate area**
2. **Ventilate** — open windows and doors
3. **Do NOT attempt to clean up** corrosive or fuming spills
4. **Call your supervisor** and follow their instructions
5. **Call 000** if anyone is exposed or the spill is hazardous

---

## 9. First Aid for Chemical Exposure

### Skin Contact
1. Remove contaminated clothing immediately
2. Flush skin with cool running water for **20 minutes**
3. Do NOT use creams, lotions, or ointments
4. Seek medical attention if redness, pain, or blistering occurs

### Eye Contact
1. Flush eyes with clean running water for **20 minutes**
2. Hold eyelids open and rotate the eyeball
3. Remove contact lenses if possible
4. **Seek medical attention immediately** — chemical eye burns are serious

### Inhalation
1. Move the person to fresh air immediately
2. If difficulty breathing, call **000**
3. If conscious, sit them upright
4. Loosen tight clothing around neck/chest

### Ingestion
1. **Do NOT induce vomiting** (corrosive chemicals burn twice)
2. Rinse mouth with water — do not swallow
3. Call **Poisons Information: 13 11 26**
4. Call **000** if the person is unconscious or having difficulty breathing
5. Take the product label or container to the hospital

## 10. Eco-Friendly Alternatives

Clean Up Bros encourages using eco-friendly products where appropriate:

- **White vinegar** — Glass, light descaling (NEVER mix with bleach)
- **Bicarb soda** — Gentle abrasive, deodoriser
- **Castile soap** — General purpose, low-toxicity
- **Microfibre cloths** — Reduce chemical use on surfaces
- **Steam cleaning** — Chemical-free sanitisation

**Note:** For NDIS clients and high-hygiene environments (Airbnb turnovers, end-of-lease), hospital-grade disinfectants are still required for toilets, kitchens, and high-touch surfaces.

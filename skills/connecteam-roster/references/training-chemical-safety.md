# Clean Up Bros — Cleaning Standards & Chemical Safety
## Staff Training Module 2

*Generated via NotebookLM from Clean Up Bros cleaning checklists and Australian industry standards*

---

**Target Audience:** Australian Professional Cleaning Staff
**Objective:** To ensure safe handling of chemicals, prevent cross-contamination, and maintain high hygiene standards in accordance with WHS compliance.

---

## 1. The Colour-Coded Cleaning System

To prevent cross-contamination (spreading bacteria from dirty areas to clean areas), we strictly adhere to the standard industry colour-coding system.

### 🔴 RED — High Risk / Sanitary Areas
- **Use for:** Toilets, urinals, and bathroom floors immediately surrounding toilets
- **Rule:** Never use red cloths or mops outside of the toilet area

### 🟡 YELLOW — Washroom Surfaces (Low Risk)
- **Use for:** Sinks, mirrors, showers, tiled walls, vanity bench tops, and changing room benches
- **Rule:** Use in bathrooms, but strictly for surfaces other than the toilet itself

### 🟢 GREEN — Food Preparation & Service Areas
- **Use for:** Kitchen benches, stove tops, microwaves, pantry shelves, dining tables, and bar areas
- **Rule:** Crucial for preventing food-borne illness. Keep these cloths pristine

### 🔵 BLUE — General Low-Risk Areas
- **Use for:** Office desks, window sills, glass cleaning, dusting, skirtings, and general waste bins
- **Rule:** Used for general areas not requiring high-level disinfection

### Cloth Management
- Wash colour-coded cloths separately
- Replace microfibre cloths every 3–6 months or when worn
- Never use a cloth from a higher-risk area in a lower-risk area
- Each cleaner should carry a set of all 4 colours

## 2. Common Chemicals & Usage

**Always refer to the specific label on the bottle. Brands differ.**

| Chemical Type | Typical Colour | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| **Neutral Detergent** | Often Pink/Orange | Multi-Purpose: Safe for floors (wood/tile), wiping desks, and general cleaning. pH neutral (won't damage surfaces) |
| **Degreaser** | Often Purple/Clear | Heavy Duty: Breaks down grease and oil. Use on kitchen range hoods, oven interiors, and greasy concrete. Requires rinsing |
| **Disinfectant** | Various | Sanitisation: Kills bacteria. Use on touchpoints (door handles), toilets, and bathroom surfaces. Must sit on surface for specific "dwell time" (e.g., 5–10 mins) to work |
| **Glass Cleaner** | Blue | Streak-Free: Mirrors and windows. Use sparingly and buff dry with a lint-free cloth or paper towel |
| **Bleach (Chlorine)** | Clear/Yellowish | Whitening/Killing Mould: Use for mould removal in showers or deep cleaning toilets. **Corrosive: Use with extreme caution** |
| **Acid Cleaners** | Various | Descaling: Removing calcium/lime scale from shower screens or toilet bowls |

### Chemical Selection by Task (Clean Up Bros Checklists)
- **Oven cleaning** → Degreaser or specialised oven cleaner
- **Range hood & exhaust fan** → Degreaser
- **Stovetop & drip trays** → Degreaser
- **Splashback & tiles** → Neutral detergent or bathroom cleaner
- **Sink, taps & drain** → Bathroom cleaner + descaler for hard water
- **Shower screen** → Acid cleaner for hard water stains
- **Toilet** → Disinfectant + toilet bowl cleaner
- **Grout & mould** → Bleach-based mould remover
- **Mirrors & glass** → Glass cleaner
- **Floors (general)** → Neutral detergent
- **Floors (bathroom)** → Disinfectant

## 3. Dilution Ratios & Mixing Rules

Incorrect dilution is a major safety hazard and cost issue.

### Why It Matters
- **Too Strong:** Damages surfaces, wastes money, causes respiratory issues
- **Too Weak:** Fails to clean or kill bacteria, wastes time

### Common Ratios (Examples Only — Always Check Label)
| Ratio | Strength | Example Mix | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1:10** | Heavy Duty | 100ml chemical in 1L bottle | Heavy degreasing, mould treatment |
| **1:20** | Medium Duty | 50ml chemical in 1L bottle | Bathroom cleaning, disinfecting |
| **1:50** | General Cleaning | 20ml chemical in 1L bottle | Bench tops, general surfaces |
| **1:100** | Light Duty/Floors | 100ml chemical in 10L mop bucket | Floor mopping, light maintenance |

### How to Mix Safely
1. **Always fill the bucket or bottle with WATER FIRST**
2. **Add the chemical SECOND**
   - **Why?** Adding water to a concentrated chemical causes it to foam up and splash back into your eyes
3. Use measuring cups — don't guess
4. Label all spray bottles with the chemical name and dilution ratio
5. Mix in a well-ventilated area
6. Wear gloves and eye protection when mixing

## 4. DANGEROUS COMBINATIONS — Never Mix!

⚠️ **Mixing chemicals can create deadly gases. NEVER mix the following:**

### Deadly Combinations
1. **Bleach + Ammonia = Chloramine Gas** (Toxic, damages lungs/eyes)
   - ⚠️ Many glass cleaners and urine removers contain ammonia
2. **Bleach + Acid = Chlorine Gas** (Deadly)
   - ⚠️ Toilet bowl cleaners and vinegar are often acidic
3. **Bleach + Rubbing Alcohol = Chloroform** (Causes unconsciousness)
4. **Hydrogen Peroxide + Vinegar = Peracetic Acid** (Corrosive to skin, eyes, lungs)

### General Rules
- **Never mix different brands** of cleaning products, even if they look the same
- **Never mix "leftover" chemicals** from different bottles
- **Rinse surfaces thoroughly** before applying a different chemical
- **When in doubt, DON'T mix** — ask your supervisor
- **If you accidentally mix chemicals:**
  1. Leave the area immediately
  2. Open windows/doors from a distance if safe
  3. Call 000 if you feel unwell
  4. Inform your supervisor

## 5. Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

Formerly known as MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets).

### What Is an SDS?
A document that lists the hazards, first aid measures, ingredients, and safe handling procedures of a chemical product.

### Key Sections of an SDS
1. **Section 1:** Product identification (name, manufacturer)
2. **Section 2:** Hazard identification (danger symbols, warnings)
3. **Section 4:** First aid measures (**most important for cleaners**)
4. **Section 7:** Handling and storage requirements
5. **Section 8:** PPE requirements

### Your Responsibilities
- **Know where the SDS folder is kept** (Cleaner's van, app, or site folder)
- If a chemical splashes in an eye or is swallowed, **consult the SDS immediately**
- Call **Poisons Information Centre: 13 11 26** or **000** for emergencies
- **Do not use a chemical if the label is missing or unreadable**
- Report missing SDS to your supervisor

## 6. Safe Storage Rules

### Storage Requirements
- Store chemicals in a **cool, dry place** away from direct sunlight
- Keep lids **tightly closed** when not in use
- Store on **stable shelving** — heavy containers on the bottom
- Keep chemicals **separated by type** (acids separate from bleach/alkaline products)
- Store away from **food, drinks, and personal items**

### Critical Rules
- ❌ **NEVER store cleaning chemicals in food containers** (old water bottles, juice jugs)
  - This is a leading cause of accidental poisoning in Australia
- ❌ **NEVER leave chemicals unattended** in client homes (especially NDIS properties)
- ❌ **NEVER store chemicals in direct sunlight or hot vehicles** for extended periods
- ✅ **Always keep chemicals in original, labelled containers**
- ✅ **Ensure child-proof caps are secured** when working in homes with children

### Vehicle Storage
- Store chemicals **upright** in a dedicated caddy/tray
- Secure the caddy so it doesn't tip during transport
- Keep an SDS folder in the vehicle
- Carry a spill kit (absorbent material, gloves, plastic bags)

## 7. Ventilation Requirements

### When Ventilation Is Required
- Using **any spray chemical** in an enclosed room
- Using **bleach, oven cleaner, or mould remover**
- Using **degreasers** in kitchens
- **Descaling** bathrooms with acid cleaners
- Any time you can **smell fumes**

### How to Ventilate
- **Open windows and doors** before starting chemical application
- Turn on **exhaust fans** (bathroom, range hood)
- If no ventilation is possible, **take regular breaks** in fresh air
- Use a **respirator/face mask** in poorly ventilated spaces

### Warning Signs — Leave the Area If:
- You feel dizzy or lightheaded
- Your eyes start watering or burning
- You have difficulty breathing
- You experience a persistent headache
- You smell an unusually strong or chemical odour

### First Aid for Chemical Inhalation
1. Move to **fresh air immediately**
2. Loosen tight clothing
3. If breathing is difficult, call **000**
4. If conscious, sit upright to help breathing
5. Report to supervisor and complete incident report

## 8. Dwell Time — Making Chemicals Work Properly

Many cleaners waste chemicals by spraying and wiping immediately. For effective cleaning:

| Product | Dwell Time | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Disinfectant | 5–10 minutes | Allows time to kill bacteria |
| Degreaser | 3–5 minutes | Softens baked-on grease |
| Mould remover | 10–15 minutes | Penetrates mould roots |
| Toilet bowl cleaner | 5–10 minutes | Breaks down stains |
| Descaler | 5–10 minutes | Dissolves mineral deposits |

**Spray → Wait → Wipe/Scrub → Rinse**

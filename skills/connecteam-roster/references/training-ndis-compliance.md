# NDIS Compliance for Cleaning Workers

> **Clean Up Bros — NDIS Worker Compliance Training Guide**
> Based on NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission requirements and NDIS Code of Conduct

## 1. What is the NDIS?

The **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)** is an Australian Government program that funds supports and services for people with disability. Cleaning falls under support category **0120 — Household Tasks**.

### Why This Matters to You
- NDIS participants are **vulnerable people** who have rights protected by law
- As a worker providing NDIS-funded services, you have **legal obligations**
- Non-compliance can result in **banning orders, fines, and criminal charges**
- Our business must maintain compliance or lose registration

## 6. Infection Control

### Standard Precautions for Every Visit
1. **Hand hygiene** — Wash hands with soap and water (or use alcohol-based sanitiser) before and after every appointment
2. **Fresh gloves** — Use a new pair of gloves for each home
3. **Clean equipment** — Ensure mops, cloths, and tools are clean before entering a participant's home
4. **Respiratory hygiene** — If you're feeling unwell (cough, cold, flu), do NOT attend the appointment. Call your supervisor to arrange a replacement.

### When to Use Enhanced Precautions
- Participant has a known infection or communicable disease
- Bodily fluids are present (blood, vomit, urine, faeces)
- Participant is immunocompromised
- During infectious disease outbreaks (COVID-19, flu season)

### Enhanced Precautions Include
- P2/N95 face mask
- Disposable gown or apron
- Eye protection (if risk of splash)
- Double gloving
- Placing contaminated materials in a biohazard bag

### Handling Bodily Fluids
1. Put on full PPE (gloves, mask, apron, eye protection)
2. Contain the area — prevent others from walking through
3. Clean with paper towels first, then disinfect with hospital-grade disinfectant
4. Dispose of contaminated materials in a sealed plastic bag
5. Wash hands thoroughly after removing PPE
6. Report to supervisor (may be a reportable incident)

### If You Are Unwell
- **Do NOT attend NDIS appointments if you have:**
  - Fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose
  - Vomiting or diarrhoea
  - Open wounds on hands (unless covered with waterproof dressing)
  - COVID-19 symptoms or positive test result
- **Notify your supervisor ASAP** so a replacement can be arranged
- Participants may be immunocompromised — what's a mild cold for you could be life-threatening for them

## 7. Reportable Incidents

### What is a Reportable Incident?
Under NDIS rules, certain incidents MUST be reported to the NDIS Commission within specific timeframes.

### Categories of Reportable Incidents

| Incident Type | Examples | Reporting Timeframe |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Death** | Death of a participant during/related to service delivery | **24 hours** |
| **Serious injury** | Burns, fractures, head injuries requiring medical treatment | **24 hours** |
| **Abuse or neglect** | Physical, sexual, emotional, financial, or neglect | **24 hours** |
| **Unlawful sexual or physical contact** | Any form of assault | **24 hours** |
| **Unauthorised use of restrictive practices** | Restraint, seclusion, restricting movement | **24 hours** |

### Your Responsibility
You are **not** expected to report directly to the NDIS Commission — that's Clean Up Bros' responsibility. But you **must**:

1. **Report to your supervisor IMMEDIATELY** — by phone, not just text
2. **Document exactly what happened** — who, what, when, where
3. **Preserve any evidence** — don't clean up or alter the scene
4. **Write your account** while it's fresh in your memory
5. **Cooperate with any investigation**

### What If You Witness Abuse or Neglect?
If you observe signs that a participant is being abused or neglected by anyone (family, other workers, carers):
- **Report it to your supervisor immediately**
- **Do NOT confront the alleged perpetrator**
- **Document what you observed** (facts only, not opinions)
- **If the participant is in immediate danger, call 000**
- If your concern is about your own organisation, you can report directly to the NDIS Commission: **1800 035 544**

## 8. Service Agreements & Participant Rights

### Service Agreements
Every NDIS participant should have a **service agreement** with Clean Up Bros that outlines:
- What cleaning tasks will be performed
- How often (weekly, fortnightly, etc.)
- Duration of each visit
- Cost and how it's billed
- Cancellation policy

### Participant Rights
NDIS participants have the right to:
- Choose their own service provider
- Be treated with dignity and respect
- Have their privacy maintained
- Be free from violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation
- Make complaints without fear of retribution
- End services at any time

### Your Role in Upholding Rights
- Always arrive at the agreed time (or notify in advance of delays)
- Perform the agreed tasks to a high standard
- Treat every participant as you would want your own family member treated
- Listen to their preferences and act on them
- Never pressure a participant to agree to additional services

---

## 9. Cultural Competency

### Working with Diverse Participants
NDIS participants come from all backgrounds. Be aware of:
- **Cultural practices** around shoes in the home, gender preferences for workers, food preparation areas
- **Communication needs** — some participants may use assistive technology, sign language, or have communication support workers
- **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants** — respect cultural protocols and ask about any specific needs
- **CALD (Culturally and Linguistically Diverse) participants** — speak clearly, use simple language, be patient

### Key Principle
> **Ask, don't assume.** Every participant is different. The best way to provide good service is to listen and adapt.

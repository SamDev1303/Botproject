# Clean Up Bros — NDIS Compliance for Cleaning
## Staff Training Module 3

*Generated via NotebookLM based on Australian NDIS regulations and industry best practices*

---

**Target Audience:** Clean Up Bros Staff working with NDIS Participants
**Objective:** To ensure all staff understand their legal and ethical obligations under the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of participants.

---

## 1. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission

As an NDIS provider, we operate under the **NDIS Code of Conduct**. All workers must adhere to these core principles:

- **Respect for Rights:** Act with respect for individual rights to freedom of expression, self-determination, and decision-making
- **Privacy:** Respect the privacy of people with disability
- **Safety:** Provide supports and services in a safe and competent manner with care and skill
- **Integrity:** Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency
- **Violence Prevention:** Promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters that may impact the quality and safety of supports provided to people with disability

### What This Means for Cleaners
- You are a **support worker** under the NDIS, not just a cleaner
- Your conduct reflects on Clean Up Bros as a registered NDIS provider
- Breaching the Code of Conduct can result in **banning orders** from the NDIS Commission
- The Commission can investigate complaints from participants, families, or the public

## 2. NDIS Worker Screening Check

Before entering an NDIS participant's home, compliance is mandatory.

### Requirements
- **Worker Screening ID:** You must hold a valid **NDIS Worker Screening Check** (formerly Yellow Card/Police Check depending on state)
- **Always Carry ID:** You must carry your photo ID and clearance card to every NDIS shift
- **Renewal:** Screening checks must be renewed every 5 years
- **Status Changes:** You must **immediately** inform management if you are charged with an offence or if your clearance status changes

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
- Working without a valid screening check is **illegal**
- Clean Up Bros can be fined or deregistered for allowing unscreened workers
- You may face personal liability and banning orders

---

## 3. Client Dignity, Privacy & Cultural Sensitivity

**You are working in someone's private home, not a public site.**

### Entering the Home
- **Always knock and wait** to be invited in, even if you have a key
- **Announce your arrival** clearly: *"Hello, it's [Name] from Clean Up Bros for your cleaning today"*
- If no one answers, **do not enter** — call the office for instructions
- **Wear shoe covers** or remove shoes if requested

### Personal Belongings
- **Do not move** personal items, medical equipment, or mobility aids without specific permission
- If you move something to clean under it, **put it back exactly where it was**
- **Never read** personal documents, mail, or notes left on tables
- **Never use** the participant's phone, computer, or personal items

### Cultural Safety
- Be aware of cultural protocols (e.g., removing shoes at the door, prayer times)
- If you are unsure, **respectfully ask** the participant or check the Service Agreement notes
- Be respectful of religious items, cultural artefacts, and traditional practices
- Some participants may prefer a cleaner of a specific gender — respect these preferences
- Use the participant's **preferred name and pronouns**

### Confidentiality
- **NEVER discuss** a participant's condition, living situation, or personal details with anyone outside of the management team
- **Do not post photos** of the worksite on social media
- **Do not gossip** about participants with other staff
- Breaching confidentiality is a **serious NDIS Code of Conduct violation**
- If someone (family member, neighbour, etc.) asks about a participant, say: *"I'm not able to discuss that. Please contact our office."*

## 4. Professional Boundaries

Maintaining professional boundaries is critical for protecting both the participant and yourself.

### Rules
- **No Gifts:** Do not accept money, gifts, or food from participants. Politely decline by citing company policy
- **No Personal Relationships:** Do not share your personal phone number, social media handles, or details about your personal life/problems with participants
- **Financial Safety:** Never offer financial advice, handle a participant's cash/credit cards, or buy items on their behalf unless strictly authorised in the care plan
- **Physical Contact:** No unnecessary physical contact. If a participant needs physical assistance, this is outside your role — refer to their support coordinator
- **Scope of Work:** Only perform the tasks outlined in the service agreement. Do not perform care tasks (medication, personal care, etc.)

### What to Do If Boundaries Are Tested
- A participant asks you to do tasks outside your role → *"I'd love to help, but for safety and insurance reasons, I can only do what's in our agreement. Let me ask the office to help with that."*
- A participant offers you a gift → *"That's so kind, but our policy doesn't allow me to accept gifts. Thank you though!"*
- A participant shares distressing information → Listen empathetically, then report to your supervisor

## 5. Infection Control in NDIS Environments

Participants may be immunocompromised or vulnerable to infection.

### Standard Precautions
- Treat **all bodily fluids and waste** as potentially infectious
- Use appropriate PPE (gloves, apron) when cleaning areas with bodily fluid contamination
- Dispose of contaminated materials in sealed bags

### Hand Hygiene — The 5 Moments
1. **Upon arrival** at the participant's home
2. **Before putting on gloves**
3. **After removing gloves**
4. **After handling waste or contaminated items**
5. **Before leaving** the participant's home

### Illness Policy
- ⚠️ **Do not work if you are sick**
- If you have cold/flu symptoms, gastro, COVID, or any contagious illness, **report to your supervisor immediately** so the shift can be rescheduled
- Entering a vulnerable person's home while sick is a **breach of duty of care**
- You will not be penalised for calling in sick — you will be penalised for coming to work sick

### Cleaning for Infection Control
- Use **colour-coded cloths** (see Module 2) to prevent cross-contamination
- **Disinfect high-touch surfaces** thoroughly:
  - Door handles and locks
  - Light switches and power points
  - Tap handles
  - Toilet flush buttons
  - Remote controls
  - Handrails
- Allow **proper dwell time** for disinfectants (5–10 minutes)
- Use **hospital-grade disinfectant** when specified in the service agreement

## 7. Service Agreements & Documentation

### Service Agreements
- These are **legal contracts** detailing what cleaning tasks we are paid to do
- **Do not deviate** from the agreed task list
- If a participant asks for extra tasks (e.g., *"Can you walk my dog?"* or *"Clean the gutters?"*), politely explain that you can only perform the agreed tasks for safety and insurance reasons, and refer them to the office
- If you notice the service agreement doesn't cover what the participant actually needs, inform your supervisor

### Record Keeping
- **Timesheets:** Must be accurate to the minute. **Fraudulent billing is a federal offence**
- **Communication Book:** If a communication book is present:
  - Sign in and out with date and time
  - Keep notes **factual and professional** (e.g., "Mopped floors, cleaned bathroom")
  - Do NOT write subjective comments (e.g., "Client was grumpy today")
- **Photos:** Take before/after photos for quality assurance if required by the service agreement
- **Incident Reports:** Complete within 24 hours of any incident

### What to Document
- Tasks completed during the visit
- Any tasks not completed and the reason why
- Any hazards or maintenance issues noticed (e.g., leaking tap, broken tile)
- Any changes in the participant's environment or well-being
- Time in and time out

## 8. Working in Shared Living / SIL Homes

Some NDIS participants live in Supported Independent Living (SIL) houses with other participants.

### Additional Considerations
- Multiple participants may have **different service agreements** — know which areas you're responsible for
- Be mindful of **other participants' privacy** — don't enter their bedrooms unless authorised
- There may be **support workers on site** — coordinate with them
- Follow any **house rules** posted by the SIL provider
- Be aware that some participants may have **behaviours of concern** — read the participant's support plan and risk assessment before your first visit

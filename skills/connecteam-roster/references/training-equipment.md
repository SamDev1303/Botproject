# Equipment Use & Maintenance Guide

## 1. Vacuum Cleaners

### Types We Use
- **Upright vacuum** — Best for carpeted areas
- **Backpack vacuum** — For large commercial spaces, stairs
- **Wet/dry vacuum** — For water extraction, flood cleanup
- **Stick vacuum** — Quick touch-ups, hard floors

### Correct Usage
1. **Before starting:**
   - Check the bag/canister — empty if more than 2/3 full
   - Check the filter — clean or replace if dirty
   - Inspect the power cord for damage
   - Check the belt and brushroll for tangles (hair, string)

2. **During use:**
   - Adjust height setting for the floor type (carpet vs hard floor)
   - Use slow, overlapping strokes for best suction
   - Vacuum edges and corners with the crevice tool
   - Don't vacuum over power cords
   - Don't vacuum large debris, liquids (unless wet/dry), or sharp objects

3. **After use:**
   - Empty the canister/replace bag
   - Clean the brushroll — remove hair and debris
   - Wipe down the exterior
   - Wrap cord neatly (don't wrap tightly around the body)
   - Store upright in a dry area

### Maintenance Schedule
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Empty bag/canister | After every use |
| Clean/check filter | Weekly |
| Clean brushroll | Weekly |
| Check belt | Monthly |
| Deep clean (wash filters, wipe internals) | Monthly |
| Replace belt | Every 6-12 months or when slipping |
| Replace filters | Every 3-6 months |

### Troubleshooting
| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Loss of suction | Full bag, clogged filter, blockage | Empty, clean, check hose |
| Burning smell | Belt slipping, motor overheat | Turn off, check belt, let cool |
| Not picking up | Wrong height setting, worn brushroll | Adjust height, replace brush |
| Loud noise | Blockage in hose or head | Clear blockage |

## 2. Steam Cleaners

### When to Use
- Deep cleaning tile and grout
- Sanitising bathrooms without chemicals
- Cleaning hard floors (sealed surfaces only)
- Refreshing upholstery and curtains
- Removing stubborn stains

### Correct Usage
1. **Before starting:**
   - Fill tank with clean water only (no chemicals unless specified)
   - Allow full heat-up time (usually 5-10 minutes)
   - Attach correct nozzle for the surface
   - Test on an inconspicuous area first

2. **During use:**
   - Hold nozzle 15-20cm from surface
   - Use steady, sweeping motions
   - Don't hold steam on one spot too long (can damage surfaces)
   - Wipe loosened dirt with a microfibre cloth
   - Refill water before tank runs completely empty

3. **⚠️ Do NOT steam clean:**
   - Unsealed wood or laminate floors
   - Delicate fabrics or silk
   - Cold glass (thermal shock can crack it)
   - Painted surfaces (may blister)
   - Electronics

### Maintenance Schedule
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Empty remaining water after use | Every use |
| Rinse tank | Every use |
| Clean nozzle attachments | After every use |
| Descale tank (vinegar/water solution) | Monthly |
| Check seals and gaskets | Monthly |
| Replace pads/cloths | When worn |

## 3. Pressure Washers

### When to Use
- Driveways, paths, and concrete areas
- Outdoor furniture and decking
- Building exteriors (with care)
- Wheelie bins
- Garage floors

### Correct Usage
1. **Before starting:**
   - Check water supply connection — no kinks in hose
   - Inspect the pressure hose for damage
   - Select correct nozzle:
     - **0° (red)** — Very high pressure, pinpoint (rarely used, can damage)
     - **15° (yellow)** — Heavy-duty cleaning, concrete
     - **25° (green)** — General purpose, most common
     - **40° (white)** — Gentle wash, windows, cars
     - **65° (black/soap)** — Detergent application

2. **During use:**
   - Start with a wider nozzle angle, increase pressure if needed
   - Keep nozzle 30-60cm from surface
   - Work in overlapping strokes, top to bottom on walls
   - Never point at people, animals, windows, or electrical outlets
   - Wear safety glasses and closed-toe shoes
   - Avoid spraying into gaps, vents, or under cladding

3. **After use:**
   - Run clean water through the system for 30 seconds
   - Turn off machine before disconnecting hoses
   - Release remaining pressure
   - Coil hoses neatly
   - Store in a dry, protected area

### Safety Warnings
- ⚠️ High-pressure water can cause serious injury — treat like a power tool
- ⚠️ Never use a petrol pressure washer indoors (carbon monoxide risk)
- ⚠️ Wear hearing protection with petrol models
- ⚠️ Be aware of electrical outlets, light fittings, and vents

### Maintenance Schedule
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Check oil level (petrol models) | Before every use |
| Inspect hose and connections | Before every use |
| Clean inlet filter | Weekly |
| Flush system with clean water | After every use |
| Check nozzles for wear | Monthly |
| Service engine (petrol models) | Annually |

## 4. Mops & Buckets

### Types of Mops
- **Flat mop (microfibre)** — Best for most hard floors, uses less water
- **String mop** — Heavy-duty, good for textured floors
- **Spray mop** — Quick clean, lightweight, good for touch-ups
- **Spin mop** — Bucket with built-in wringer, efficient

### Correct Mopping Technique
1. Sweep or vacuum first — always remove loose dirt before mopping
2. Fill bucket with correct cleaning solution (follow dilution ratios)
3. Wring mop well — the floor should be damp, not soaked
4. Mop in a figure-8 or S-pattern for best coverage
5. Work backwards toward the exit — don't mop yourself into a corner!
6. Change water when it becomes dirty
7. Place WET FLOOR signs

### Mop Care
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Rinse mop thoroughly | After every use |
| Machine wash microfibre mop heads | Weekly (no fabric softener) |
| Replace string mop heads | Monthly or when frayed |
| Clean and dry bucket | After every use |
| Sanitise mop heads | Weekly (soak in diluted bleach) |
| Replace microfibre pads | Every 2-3 months |

### Important Rules
- Never leave a mop head sitting in dirty water
- Stand mops upright to air dry — prevents mould and bacteria
- Use separate mops for bathrooms and general areas
- Microfibre mops: wash in hot water, NO fabric softener (ruins fibres)

## 5. Microfibre Cloths

### Colour-Coding System
| Colour | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **Red** | Bathrooms and toilets |
| **Blue** | Glass, mirrors, general surfaces |
| **Green** | Kitchen and food areas |
| **Yellow** | High-risk/isolation areas |

### Usage Tips
- Fold cloth into quarters — gives you 8 clean surfaces per cloth
- Use damp, not soaking wet
- Don't use with bleach or fabric softener (degrades fibres)
- Replace when they stop absorbing or feel slippery

### Washing Microfibre
- Machine wash in warm/hot water
- NO fabric softener (clogs the microfibres)
- NO bleach (weakens the fibres)
- Dry on low heat or air dry
- Wash separately from cotton/lint-producing fabrics

## 6. General Equipment Care Rules

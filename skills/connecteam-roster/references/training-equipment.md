## 2. Vacuum Cleaners

### Types We Use

| Type | Best For | Key Features |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Upright vacuum** | Large carpet areas | Powerful suction, beater bar for deep carpet cleaning |
| **Backpack vacuum** | Commercial & multi-level | Hands-free, reduces bending, fast room-to-room transitions |
| **Canister vacuum** | Hard floors, stairs, upholstery | Versatile attachments, good for tight spaces |
| **Stick/cordless vacuum** | Quick touch-ups, Airbnb turnovers | Lightweight, fast deployment, limited battery life |
| **Wet & dry vacuum** | Spills, flood clean-up, end-of-lease | Handles liquids and solids, essential for deep cleans |

### Operating Guidelines
1. **Check the bag/canister** before each job — empty when ¾ full (not completely full)
2. **Check the filter** — clean or replace as per manufacturer instructions
3. **Inspect the cord** for damage (fraying, exposed wires) — report and tag out if damaged
4. **Check the belt** (upright models) — if the brush roller isn't spinning, the belt may be worn
5. **Select the right height setting** — too low drags and overheats; too high reduces suction
6. **Use appropriate attachments:**
   - Crevice tool → edges, corners, between cushions
   - Upholstery brush → furniture, curtains
   - Hard floor head → tiles, timber (switch off beater bar)
   - Dusting brush → shelves, vents, skirting boards

### Vacuuming Technique
- Vacuum in **slow, overlapping passes** — rushing misses dirt
- Work from the **far corner toward the exit** (don't vacuum yourself in)
- **Lift cords and obstacles** rather than running over them
- On carpets: vacuum in **two directions** (north-south then east-west) for deep clean
- **Never vacuum up:** water (unless wet/dry vac), glass shards (sweep first), large debris, powder in large quantities (clogs filter)

### Maintenance Schedule
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Empty bag/canister | Every job (or when ¾ full) |
| Clean/check filter | Weekly |
| Check belt and brush roller | Fortnightly |
| Wipe exterior and cord | After each job |
| Full deep clean | Monthly |
| Replace filters | Every 3-6 months (or as manufacturer specifies) |
| Replace belt | Every 6-12 months |

## 3. Mops and Mopping Systems

### Types We Use

| Type | Best For | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Flat mop (microfibre)** | General mopping, Airbnb turnovers | Lightweight, efficient, easy to wash pads |
| **String mop + bucket** | Heavy-duty mopping, large areas | Good absorbency, requires wringer |
| **Spray mop** | Quick touch-ups, spot mopping | Built-in spray, lightweight |
| **Dual-bucket system** | End-of-lease, deep cleans | Clean water separate from dirty — better hygiene |

### Mopping Technique
1. **Sweep or vacuum first** — mopping over debris creates mud
2. **Prepare solution** — correct dilution of floor cleaner in warm water
3. **Wring mop thoroughly** — the floor should be damp, not flooded
4. **Mop in an S-pattern or figure-8** — covers more area efficiently
5. **Work backward toward the exit** — don't mop yourself into a corner
6. **Change water** when it becomes dirty (at least every 2-3 rooms)
7. **Place wet floor signs** or warn occupants

### Microfibre Pad Care
- **Wash after every use** — machine wash warm (40-60°C), no fabric softener
- **Don't use bleach** on microfibre — it destroys the fibres
- **Air dry or tumble dry low** — high heat damages microfibre
- **Replace** when pads are worn, flat, or no longer picking up dirt effectively
- Typical lifespan: **200-300 washes** for quality microfibre

## 4. Steam Cleaners

### When to Use Steam
- **Tile and grout cleaning** — loosens built-up grime without chemicals
- **Bathroom sanitisation** — kills bacteria and mould with heat
- **Kitchen degreasing** — cuts through grease on stovetops and rangehoods
- **Mattress and upholstery** — kills dust mites and sanitises
- **Chemical-free cleaning** — ideal for NDIS participants with chemical sensitivities

### Operating Guidelines
1. **Fill with distilled or demineralised water** (tap water causes mineral build-up)
2. **Allow full heat-up time** — don't start until the unit indicates ready (usually 3-5 minutes)
3. **Test on an inconspicuous area first** — some surfaces can be damaged by heat
4. **Keep the nozzle moving** — don't hold steam in one spot too long
5. **Wipe up moisture** after steaming — steam loosens dirt, but you still need to wipe it away
6. **Use appropriate attachments:**
   - Small round brush → grout lines, corners
   - Floor head → tile floors, sealed hardwood
   - Cloth attachment → glass, mirrors, benchtops
   - Nozzle → tight spaces, taps, fixtures

### Do NOT Steam
- ❌ Unsealed wood or timber floors (moisture damage)
- ❌ Painted walls (can bubble or peel paint)
- ❌ Delicate fabrics (silk, velvet)
- ❌ Cold glass or mirrors (thermal shock can crack them — let the glass warm first)
- ❌ Vinyl or laminate floors if manufacturer advises against steam

### Maintenance
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Empty remaining water after use | Every use |
| Wipe exterior and cord | After each use |
| Descale with white vinegar solution | Monthly |
| Check and replace brushes/pads | As needed |
| Inspect hose and fittings for leaks | Monthly |

## 5. Pressure Washers

### When to Use
- Outdoor areas: driveways, patios, balconies
- Garage floors
- Exterior walls and fences (with care)
- Wheelie bins
- Outdoor furniture

### Safety Precautions — CRITICAL
⚠️ **Pressure washers are DANGEROUS if misused**

1. **Never point at people or animals** — high pressure can cause serious injury (skin penetration, eye damage)
2. **Wear safety glasses and closed-toe shoes** — always
3. **Start on the lowest pressure setting** and increase as needed
4. **Keep a safe distance** from the surface (at least 30cm for most cleaning)
5. **Use the correct nozzle:**
   - 0° (red) → NEVER use on cleaning jobs (concrete cutting only)
   - 15° (yellow) → Heavy-duty stripping, tough stains (use with extreme caution)
   - 25° (green) → General cleaning, driveways, patios
   - 40° (white) → Light cleaning, windows, cars
   - Soap nozzle (black) → Applying detergent
6. **Check the area** for electrical cables, fragile items, pets, and children before starting
7. **Don't use on:**
   - ❌ Painted surfaces (strips paint)
   - ❌ Timber decks (damages wood grain)
   - ❌ Single-glazed or old windows (can crack)
   - ❌ Air conditioning units or electrical boxes
   - ❌ Vehicles with damaged paint

### Operating Steps
1. Connect water supply and ensure good water flow BEFORE starting the unit
2. Check connections for leaks
3. Start the motor/engine
4. Squeeze the trigger to release air from the line
5. Select appropriate nozzle
6. Work in smooth, overlapping sweeping motions
7. Maintain consistent distance from the surface
8. After use: turn off motor first, then release remaining pressure, then disconnect water

### Maintenance
| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Flush clean water through after use | Every use |
| Check and clean inlet filter | Before each use |
| Inspect hose and connections | Before each use |
| Check oil level (petrol models) | Monthly |
| Winterise/store properly | When not in use for extended periods |

## 6. Cleaning Cloths and Tools

### Microfibre Cloths — Colour Coding System

| Colour | Use | Why |
|--------|-----|-----|
| 🔵 **Blue** | General surfaces, dusting, furniture | Low risk areas |
| 🟢 **Green** | Kitchen, food preparation areas | Food-safe areas |
| 🔴 **Red** | Bathroom — toilets, urinals | High contamination risk |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Bathroom — sinks, mirrors, surfaces | Medium contamination risk |

### Why Colour Coding Matters
- **Prevents cross-contamination** — you never want a toilet cloth used on a kitchen bench
- **Meets hygiene standards** — required for NDIS, Airbnb, and commercial work
- **Professional standard** — shows clients we take hygiene seriously

### Other Essential Tools

| Tool | Use | Tips |
|------|-----|------|
| **Squeegee** | Windows, shower screens, mirrors | Wipe blade between strokes for streak-free results |
| **Scrubbing brush** | Grout, textured floors, tough stains | Use appropriate pressure — don't damage surfaces |
| **Grout brush (small)** | Tile grout lines | Small circular motions work best |
| **Duster (extendable)** | Ceiling fans, high shelves, vents | Work from top to bottom |
| **Bucket and caddy** | Carrying supplies | Keep organised — saves time per room |
| **Spray bottles** | Chemical application | Always labelled with product name and dilution |
| **Razor scraper** | Paint on glass, sticker residue | Use at 45° angle, wet surface first, GLASS ONLY |

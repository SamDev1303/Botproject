# Connecteam Overhaul

This skill manages the complete visual and structural overhaul of the Connecteam platform to align with Clean Up Bros branding and operational needs.

## Workflow

1. **Tab Focus**: Always work within a SINGLE Connecteam tab. Close all redundant tabs immediately.
2. **Branding**:
    - Reference https://cleanupbros.com.au for visual style (blue/white aesthetic).
    - Use Nano Banana to generate high-end logos and badges.
    - Update staff IDs and platform branding with these assets.
3. **Staff Bios**: Refine all bios to be professional, consistent, and reflective of the staff's roles and experience.
4. **Navigation Cleanup**: Strip the side navigation of all features not strictly necessary for running a cleaning business. Keep the interface lean and functional.
5. **Form Finalization**: Review and perfect all cleaning forms (End of Lease, Deep Clean, General Clean, Airbnb Turnover).
6. **Logging**: Update `dashboard-data.json` and session memory after every significant change.

## Tools & Context
- **Browser**: Profile "chrome".
- **Model**: Use Gemini for larger context window when performing these complex UI tasks.
- **Official Creator**: If new repetitive sub-tasks emerge, use `skill-creator` to package them.

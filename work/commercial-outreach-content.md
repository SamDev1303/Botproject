### Post 1: Childcare Cleaning Tips

🧸 5 Cleaning Spots Most Childcare Centers Miss (But Shouldn't!)

Running a daycare? Here are the spots that need extra attention:

1. **Light switches & door handles** - touched 100+ times daily
2. **Under tables & mats** - food crumbs = pest attraction
3. **Toy bins** - breeding ground for germs between washes
4. **Bathroom door latches** - at kid height = extra germs
5. **Sleep room mattress covers** - need weekly deep clean

Quick tip: Use a black light to spot missed areas - you'll be surprised!

What's your biggest cleaning challenge in your center? 👇

### Post 2: Office Cleaning Advice

```
🏢 Why Your Office Cleaner Might Be Making You Sick

Real talk from someone in the cleaning industry:

❌ Reusing the same cloth for desks AND toilets
❌ Vacuuming before dusting (spreads dust everywhere)
❌ Not emptying bins daily (hello, mold)
❌ Skipping keyboard/phone sanitization

What to look for in a good commercial cleaner:
✅ Color-coded cloths (different areas)
✅ HEPA filter vacuums
✅ Documented cleaning checklists
✅ Insurance coverage

Your staff's health is worth the investment. 💪

Anyone dealt with unreliable cleaners before? What happened?

### Post 4: Medical/Dental Cleaning

```
🏥 Medical Practice Cleaning: What You Should Be Asking Your Cleaner

If you run a clinic or dental practice, infection control is everything.

Questions to ask your cleaning company:

1. Do they use hospital-grade disinfectants?
2. Are their staff trained in healthcare cleaning protocols?
3. Do they follow proper PPE procedures?
4. Can they provide compliance documentation?
5. Are they insured for medical facility cleaning?

The cheapest quote isn't always the smartest choice when patient safety is on the line.

### Post 5: Small Business General

💡 3 Signs It's Time to Outsource Your Business Cleaning

Running a small business? Here's when DIY cleaning stops making sense:

1. **You're cleaning at 10pm** - Your time is worth more than $30/hour
2. **Staff are complaining** - Dirty bathrooms = unhappy team
3. **Clients notice** - First impressions matter

The math: If you earn $100/hour and spend 3 hours weekly cleaning, you're losing $15,600/year in productivity.

Professional cleaning = you focus on making money.

Who else has made the switch? Worth it? 👇

That's so frustrating - been there! The industry definitely has some cowboys.

Tips for next time:
• Ask for their ABN and verify it
• Get everything in writing before starting
• Trial period of 2-4 weeks before signing contracts

Hope you find someone reliable! 👊

### When Someone Asks About Cleaning Pricing:

```
Pricing varies a lot depending on:
• Size of space
• Frequency (daily/weekly/fortnightly)
• Type of business (office vs medical vs childcare)
• After-hours vs during business hours

Generally for commercial:
• Small office: $80-150/clean
• Medical practice: $150-300/clean
• Childcare center: $200-400/clean

Always get 3 quotes and compare scope, not just price!

### Post 1: Business Value

```
Unpopular opinion: A clean workspace isn't a luxury - it's a business strategy.

Studies show:
📈 23% increase in productivity in clean environments
🤒 40% reduction in sick days
💼 67% of clients judge businesses by cleanliness

Yet most businesses see cleaning as a cost to minimize, not an investment to optimize.

The companies winning right now? They're the ones who understand that employee wellness and client experience start with the basics.

What does your workspace say about your business?

### Post 2: Building Relationships

```
Just had a great conversation with a childcare center director in Western Sydney.

Her #1 frustration? Cleaners who don't understand that childcare cleaning isn't the same as office cleaning.

Kids put everything in their mouths. Surfaces need child-safe products. Toy sanitization is non-negotiable. Sleep rooms need extra care.

It reminded me why specialization matters.

What's your industry's unique cleaning challenge?

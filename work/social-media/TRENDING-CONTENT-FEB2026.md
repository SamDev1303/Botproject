## 1. Satisfying Transformations (Viral-Friendly)

### Extreme Before/After Rooms
- Hook: "This is why your bond doesn't come back."
- 1-2s pan of dirty room → hard cut to spotless result timed to beat drop
- CTA: "Comment 'QUOTE' and I'll DM prices for your place."

### 0-100 Airbnb Turnover in 10 Seconds
- Time-lapse full turnover: beds, bathroom, kitchen, rubbish out
- Text beats: "Guest out 10am → New guest 2pm → No stress for host."
- CTA: "Tag an Airbnb host who needs this."

### Commercial Floor Glow-Ups
- Dirty retail/office floor → machine scrub → reflective finish
- Hook: "The floor your customers notice but never mention."

## 2. Relatable "Cleaning Life" Reels (Personality + Shares)

### "POV: You Finally Hire Cleaners"
- Confident/playful audio, walk through finished home like grand tour
- Text: "POV: you stopped stressing about inspections and hired pros."

### Worst Cleaning Chore Poll
- Faceless reel: text over B-roll (toilet, oven, shower screen)
- Text: "Pick one I clean for free (if you book weekly): A) Oven B) Shower C) Toilet"
- Great for comments + saves

### "Day in the Life on Site"
- Quick cuts: loading gear, clock in, dirtiest moment, final result
- Hook: "If you think cleaners just 'wipe benches'…"

## 3. Fast How-To / Hack Reels (Saves + Shares)

### One-Problem, One-Hack Clips
- "Hard water on glass? Try this:" show product + motion, no long talk
- Max 10-12s, text on screen does the teaching
